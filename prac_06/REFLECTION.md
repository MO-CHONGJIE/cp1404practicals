# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I didn't start working by my own when I read the questions.
Instead, I followed the steps in question's guidebook one by one.  

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I'm still too slow when solving problems, especially with new knowledge.
The questions aren't usually very hard, but my main problem is lack of practice.  

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I'm trying to do more practice to get better at coding

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

To solve problems faster, I'll focus better and avoid distractions when practicing.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Could we rearrange the classroom to improve blackboard and screen visibility?
