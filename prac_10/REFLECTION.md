# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

I'm still not very good at coding tasks, so I usually think for over 40
minutes.

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates are usually pretty accurate because I leave myself enough
time to think about the code.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I estimate the time needed by judging how hard the problem is. The faster
I understand the difficulty, the better I can estimate.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I still need to improve my coding skills to save more time.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I should add more comments to my functions.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Some people used simpler code to do the same thing. I should learn how
to make my code cleaner.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

### Explanation

The code doesn't need to repeat this constant, cause that's invalid code.

### Good Code Review 2

[https://github.com/YoungJCU/CP1404Prac/pull/3](https://github.com/YoungJCU/CP1404Prac/pull/3)

### Explanation

Constants in dictionaries should be uppercase for better readability.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would slightly reduce the number of tasks to allow more time for
understanding and revision.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Exchange and share coding tips with classmates.
