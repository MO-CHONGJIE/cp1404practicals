# CP1404 Practicals Repository
My repo is https://github.com/MO-CHONGJIE/cp1404practicals, where you can find my every week prac.

## About me
Love music, animals and holidays.

Clean Code Lessons Learned:
- Meaningful naming: Variable, function and class names should clearly show their purposes.
- Single responsibility principle: Each function/class should do only one thing.
- Keep code simple: Avoid repeated code (DRY principle), and use appropriate functions
- and classes to organize code.
