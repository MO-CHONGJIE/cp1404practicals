# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have watched about 60% of the lecture videos so far.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch lecture videos in the school library, especially in the afternoon,
typically from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have always maintained the habit of not using AI tools to help me answer questions or
modify questions. I believe that code should be learned and used independently by myself.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I should communicate more with my classmates and teachers about code issues.
In this way, my problems can be solved more efficiently.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I think the two most important things are to put in more effort and be more dedicated.
I will try my best to actively participate in the courses related to code learning.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

The answer is NO. I think I still have many areas for improvement, and I have to
do it on my own.
